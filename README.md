# Student-Dropout-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a student is likely to drop out based on academic, social, and personal factors using Machine Learning.

It is built as a resume-level ML project for aspiring Data Analysts / Data Scientists, with clean structure, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Predict student dropout risk using real student data and machine learning models, so that early intervention can be planned in educational institutions.

This type of system can help:

Schools & colleges

Education platforms

NGOs & education departments
to identify at-risk students early.

📂 Dataset Information

File: student dropout.csv

Rows: 649

Columns: 34

Target column: Dropped_Out (True / False)

Features include:

Demographics: Gender, Age, Address

Family background: Parents education, family size, parental status

Academic performance: Grades, absences

Lifestyle factors: Alcohol consumption, health status, free time

Social factors: Going out, family support, etc.

This is a realistic educational dataset, not synthetic.

🧠 ML Workflow

The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Encoding categorical features
